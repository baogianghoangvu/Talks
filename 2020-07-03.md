## Generic advice

- [Beware of advice](https://sivers.org/advice)
- Listen to your body.
  - Eyes
    - "Too bright" screen: OS/app dark mode, [Dark Reader](https://www.darkreader.org/), etc.

- Read, a lot. Skim for info, know what is possible, keep at the back of your mind, dig deep when required.

## Python for data science

- ~~Listen to your heart.~~
- ~~Follow your passion.~~

### Getting in

#### What to learn

- Python: Basic syntax
- Tooling: Anaconda, Jupyter notebook
- Choosing where to learn from
- Installing your own local Anaconda

#### How to learn

- Python Basic: basically anything will do.
- Anaconda: install; glance at the options, tabs; open Jupyter Notebook
- Where to learn:
  - See if the teacher/platform cares or just in this for the \$\$\$.
  - Read ***negative*** reviews
  - See how the teacher/platform addresses criticism/scandals
- Installing Anaconda:
  - Do it.
  - Get used to reinstalling apps, OS.

#### Getting out

- Python alternatives: R, Julia, etc.
- Data science alternatives: ???
- Don't "Never give up"

### Climbing up

#### What to learn

- Python: Fancy syntax, (some) software engineering best practices
  - Version control
  - Code formatter
  - Linter
  - Test
- Workflow: prototype, version control, refactor, test.
- Tooling:
  - Anaconda
  - Jupyter notebook/lab + extensions
  - VS Code + extensions
  - [Fork.dev](https://fork.dev/)
  - Terminal
  - non-standard Python libraries
  - R
- Giving back, *pay money* for ***free stuff***.
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/python-dev/)
  - [NumFocus](https://github.com/sponsors/numfocus) (umbrella sponsor for Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Bokeh, etc.)
  - [DarkReader](https://opencollective.com/darkreader), [f.lux](https://www.paypal.me/justgetflux/10), [Fork.dev](https://fork.dev/buy)
  - .........................
- Ethics:
  - Does your work hurt anyone?

#### How to learn

- Python, workflow, tools:
  - Use them regularly
  - Be willing to make yourself uncomfortable by [learning new things/tools](https://twitter.com/jakevdp/status/1214785249978175489)
  - Be willing to make yourself comfortable by upgrading old things/tools
  - Data science workflow example: [Reproducible Data Analysis in Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYCpMb24GpOC704uO9svUrihl-HY1tTJJ)
- Believing that ***You*** matter, [your efforts & donations matter](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)
